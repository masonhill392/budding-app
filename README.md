//ABOUT
//Budding is an app designed to help individuals complete their tasks each day, by using 'pets' as collateral.
//You adopt a pet in the app where you want to complete a task. Name your pet and set other corresponding details, and set its activity to the activity you want completed.
//You must be at the same location where the pet was adopted to complete the task. Pets enjoy spending time with you, and to spend time with you means to complete its corresponding activity.
//Multiple pets can be adopted. Once all pets have their activities completed, the user is prompted with an input asking how long pets can rest (how long until the user will repeat tasks).
